When variables have different units or scales, it can lead to the undue influence of certain features in the analysis, resulting in incorrect or misleading conclusions.\\n\\nFor example, imagine a dataset containing information about people's heights and weights. Height might be measured in centimeters, while weight is measured in kilograms. If you were to use these raw measurements to cluster people into groups based on their physical characteristics, the height variable would dominate the analysis because its values are much larger than the weight values. As a result, the clustering outcome would be largely determined by differences in height, and the role of weight would be underemphasized.\\n\\nBy normalizing the data, each feature is scaled to a common range (e.g., between 0 and 1), allowing the analysis to consider each variable's contribution more equally. This ensures that the analysis is not dominated by a single variable and leads to more accurate and meaningful results.\",\n      \"correct_feedback\": \"Correct\",\n      \"incorrect_feedback\": \"Incorrect\"\n    }\n  ]\n}"
